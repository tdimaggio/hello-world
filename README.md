# hello-world
First GitHub Respository

I'm not good with Software Development.  I figured learning GitHub would be a good idea since it seems all the cool kids are using it these days.

I look playing with Raspberry Pi.  I've built a HeaterMeter using code from GitHub and a dog survailence system with another RPi and  MotionPie
